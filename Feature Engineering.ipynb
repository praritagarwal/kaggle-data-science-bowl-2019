    "\n",
    "1) Need to think what will I do for 'assessment' sessions where an attempt was never made. One way is to completely remove them from the data -> for training set this does not pose a problem because trainlbls only contains the results of completed assessments. Since we directly use trainlbls to obtain the assessment results, therefore incomplete assessments don't event appear. -> However, they will still contribute to other statistics such as number of assessments and avg. number of events per assessment as well as cummulative time spent on assessments. Perhaps this is how it should be done. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) results of assessments in the test data are not given explicity. Will have to check if these can also be obtained from trainlbls or will need to be extracted from event_data?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) In the function, count_prev_sessions when I compute avg. accuracy or accuracy_group_mode, I need to only choose one row per good_session. The way I am doing it right now, it chooses all the rows in good_session.This implies the accuracy and accuracy_group of a session are considered n_events times. Here n_events is the number of events in the session. This might not be a problem for avg. accuracy but the accuracy_group_mode can and will be incorrectly swayed by sessions with high event_count. -> Again because I am using trainlbls directly to obtain the assessment results, this will not be a problem since trainlbls only contains one row per session.
